The package server is great for many situations. Let's see some of them:
Small to medium projects

Everything works out of the box, you get great support for most features and you can easily tap into Express' middleware ecosystem. What's not to love?

Some of the included features: body and file parsers, cookies, sessions, websockets, Redis, gzip, favicon, csrf, SSL, etc. They just work so you will save a headache or two and can focus on your actual project. Get a simple form going:

const server = require('server');
const { get, post } = server.router;
const { render, redirect } = server.reply;

server(
  get('/', () => render('index.pug')),
  post('/', ctx => {
    console.log(ctx.data);
    return redirect('/');
  })
);
